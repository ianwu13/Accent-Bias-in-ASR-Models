# Accent-Bias-in-ASR-Models

## Data Processing
Data preprocessing scripts are contained in the `data` directory. This directory should also be used to store the actual dataset. Scripts use globals for pathing, as the directory structure is assumed to be static. These can easily be altered to apply these scripts to alternative data/directory structures, however.

### Accent mappings
A mapping for accent lables present in the original data to accent groups on which we perform our comparative analysis is stored as a json object in `accents.json`. This mapping was generated by us, based on literature review and the samples in the dataset

### `preprocess_tabular_data.py`
Preprocesses the original tsv file containing all dataset samples (excluding actual audio files). This process includes filtering rows without valid accent labels, mapping accent labels to groups, and text preprocessing for the sentence spoken in the recording.

### `filter_for_accent.py`
This script is redundant to `preprocess_tabular_data.py`, which also performs filtering. However, this script was used to help facilitate the design of our experimental setup and for determining accent groups to be used.

### `download_data.py.py`
Downloads audio files only for valid samples (those with selected accent labels). Valid samples are provided from a .tsv file. Samples is retrieved from the HuggingFace Hub, then cross referenced with the file before being saved as a .wav file.

### `create_agglomerative_samples.py`
